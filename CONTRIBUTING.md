# Contributing to `fit` - A Simplified Version of Git

First off, thank you for considering contributing to `fit`! It's people like you that make `fit` such a great tool.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Clone your fork locally.
- Configure the upstream repo (`git remote add upstream <main-repo-URL>`).
- Create a local branch (`git checkout -b your-branch-name`).
- Work on your feature or bug fix.
- Push your changes to your fork.
- Submit a pull request from your forked repo to our main repo.

## Code Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
- Your code should adhere to the existing coding conventions in the project.
- Write tests for your feature or bug fix.
- Ensure the test suite passes before submitting a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rafaelmgr12/git-clone/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rafaelmgr12/git-clone/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear list of what you want to add.
- Remember, contributions should be focused and contain a clear end goal. A good contribution should not only be a patch but also a learning experience for others.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. Ensure that your PR includes clear commit messages and is rebased on the latest master.
5. Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers, who might suggest some changes or improvements.

Remember, the more detailed and clear your contribution guidelines are, the easier it is for others to follow them. Adjustments might be needed based on the project's requirements and the community's practices.
